I developed a stuttering speech therapy app aimed at helping individuals with speech disorders. The app utilizes Apple's Speech Framework for real-time speech recognition and integrates a custom CoreML model to detect stuttering patterns in the user's speech. By analyzing audio input, the app provides instant feedback, helping users monitor their progress and improve fluency over time. This project allowed me to work with advanced technologies like machine learning and AVFoundation, while contributing to a meaningful cause in the field of speech therapy.
